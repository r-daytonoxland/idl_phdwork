PRO synth_n2_1p, range, T, wl, int, width, labels, weights=weights
;
; Function to generate a synthetic N2 1P auroral spectrum.
;
; At the moment this does it the slow way! Have a look at speeding things
; up at some point...
;
; Inputs:
;  range - 2-element vector with wavelength range desired, in A
;  T     - Temperature, either scalar or a vector array, in K
; Outputs:
;  All arrays with the same number of elements.
;  wl    - Wavelengths of the N2 lines, in A
;  int   - Intensities of the N2 lines, normalised so the total is 1.
;  width - The width of each line due to Doppler broadening, FWHM in A.
;  labels - A string array of labels for each line, in the format
;           'N2 1PG (4-2)'. Currently just gives info on the
;           vibrational band, so many lines will have the same label.
; Keywords:
;  weights - Ignored unless T is an array, see description below.
;
; If T is a single number this routine gives the spectrum for that
; temperature.
; If T is an array, the spectrum at each temperature in T is generated
; and then summed. If the weights keyword is set to an array with the
; same number of elements as T then the weighted sum is calculated,
; useful e.g. for generating an integrated spectrum for a temperature
; profile.
;
; Note water vapour absorption is not considered in this routine.

; This will always output 2d arrays, first dimension temperature,
; even for only one temperature. This is slow!

; Now just generate spectra for a bunch of temperatures and then interpolate,
; until prog_n2_1p... can be made much faster. This speeds things up when
; using this routine in an iterative spectrum fitting process.
